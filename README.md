# SolanaPay Demo Project

yay! This project was created as part a submission under the **Solana Summer Fellowship by [SuperTeam](https://superteam.fun)**, showcasing the integration of SolanaPay with a simple e-commerce interface. The demo allows users to generate payment links and QR codes for purchasing products using SOL, providing a foundational understanding of how to incorporate solana crypto payments into a web application.

## Introduction
This project is a demo application built as part of the Solana Fellowship to demonstrate how SolanaPay can be used to facilitate Point of Sales payments and I decided to demonstrate that using e-commerce approach. üòá The application lists a few dummy products and allows users to generate payment links and QR codes for making payments in SOL.

## Features
- List of dummy products with SOL prices.
- Ability to generate payment links using SolanaPay.
- QR code generation for easy payments.
- Payment Verification and Validations
- Transaction Success Page
- Cart
- Simple, easy-to-understand codebase ideal for learning and experimenting with SolanaPay.

## Note to Developers
Thought I should share this...  üôÇ
**Important:** This project is a demo, and **in real development, reference, products and their pricing should be handled on the server side**. Managing product data and prices on the client side, as done in this demo, is not secure and can obviously be easily manipulated by users. Always ensure sensitive information, such as product pricing and the reference, is securely managed on the server to prevent unauthorized modifications and ensure the integrity of transactions.
